Run PsList artifact then edit the resulting notebook

// Get a free VT api key
LET VTKey <= ""
// Build the list of untrusted processes first
Let Results = SELECT Fqdn,Name,CommandLine,Hash.SHA256 AS SHA256, count() AS Count FROM source()
GROUP BY Name,SHA256



// Now combine the previous query with the Server Enrichment query
SELECT *, {SELECT VTRating FROM Artifact.Server.Enrichment.Virustotal(VirustotalKey=VTKey, Hash=SHA256) } AS VTResults FROM foreach(row=Results) WHERE Count < 10
ORDER BY VTResults DESC




/*
# Windows.System.Pslist
*/
SELECT * FROM source(artifact="Windows.System.Pslist")
LIMIT 50



Works - run System.Dll artifact work then edit in notebook - Might need to adjust the Group BY

LET VTKey <= ""

LET Results = SELECT Fqdn,Pid,Name,ModuleName,ExePath,Hash.SHA256 as SHA256, count() AS Count FROM source()



SELECT  *, {SELECT VTRating FROM Artifact.Server.Enrichment.Virustotal(VirustotalKey=VTKey, Hash=SHA256) } AS VTResults FROM foreach(row=Results) WHERE Count < 10

ORDER BY VTResults DESC




SELECT * FROM source(artifact="Windows.System.DLLs")
LIMIT 50
